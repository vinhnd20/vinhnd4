# Intro

I’m a Cloud and DevSecOps Engineer passionate about building secure, scalable, and innovative platforms that empower digital transformation. My expertise spans Platform Engineering, Cloud Computing, DevOps, and DevSecOps, with a focus on designing robust CI/CD pipelines, cloud-native architectures, and user-centric tools. My work integrates hands-on development with research to optimize system performance, enhance security, and streamline operations.

At MB Bank, I designed DevSecOps practices, embedding security into CI/CD pipelines to ensure resilient internal services. At Viettel Cloud, I contributed to building Viettel Cloud’s ecosystem, including its Internal Developer Platform (IDP) and Database as a Service (DBaaS), driving efficiency and innovation for cloud-native workflows. My projects, such as Viettel vGit and DevOps Sphere, reflect my commitment to creating solutions that bridge theory and practice.

I actively contribute to open-source communities, developing plugins and features for DevSecOps and cloud orchestration that are adopted globally. My academic foundation in Information Technology from PTIT (GPA: 3.65/4) and achievements like Viettel Digital Talent 2023 and speaking at OpenInfra Cloud Native Day Vietnam 2024 fuel my drive to push boundaries in cloud technology.

I’ve led and contributed to several impactful projects and tools, including:
- **Viettel vGit Enhancements** ([Details](https://viettelcloud.vn/en)): Extended Viettel’s version control system with Software Composition Analysis, IaC Scanning, Secret Detection, and Container Scanning, integrated with Jira and Telegram using Kubernetes, Go, and Webhooks.
- **Viettel Cloud DevOps Sphere** ([Details](https://viettelcloud.vn/en)): Developed a plugin for Viettel’s DevOps Portal with Backstage, Kusion, Crossplane, and ArgoCD, streamlining resource management via GitOps.
- **Enterprise DBaaS with OpenStack Trove** ([Details](https://viettelcloud.vn/en)): Engineered a high-availability database cluster with semi-synchronous replication and automatic failover, presented at OpenInfra Summit Asia 2024.
- **DBaaS Connection Pool** ([Details](https://viettelcloud.vn/en)): Optimized PostgreSQL performance using PgBouncer for load balancing and health checks in multi-tenant setups.
- **Point-in-Time Backup & Recovery** ([Details](https://viettelcloud.vn/en)): Implemented a backup solution for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL with Ceph Object Storage, ensuring production-grade data integrity.

These contributions, many open-source, empower developers and organizations with secure, efficient, and scalable cloud solutions. My work has been recognized with an accepted paper at FAIR 2024 and a presentation at OpenInfra Asia.
